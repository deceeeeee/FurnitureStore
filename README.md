# FurnitureStore
This Furniture Store Website is my final thesis project. The project is focusing on recommendation system and transaction module. 

## Software and Programming Language Used
Back-end Development: JSP(Java Server Page) and JavaScript
Front-end Design: HTML and CSS are used.
Database Management: mySQL, with PHPMyAdmin
Code Editor: Eclipse

## Website Features
1. Shopping Cart

   Shopping Cart is the cart for customer to put commodities that they want to buy.
   In the shopping cart page, user can add or remove the commodity in their cart.

2. User Management

   There are 4 types of user in this website. There is administrator, seller, customer, and visitor.
   - Administrator has the highest authority in the website. Administrator user can open other users info,
     remove their account, managing product database, check e-mail subscriber, and suggestions given by customers.
   - Seller can sell their products through the website. The website provides this type of user a catalog of their own.
     Uploaded products by seller will be stored in this page. Seller can also receive order from customers and respond to them.
   - Customer can comment, use shopping cart system, and buy products. This type of user can also print their invoice and check
     their order progress. They can give suggestions about the service or website to the administrator.
   - Visitor are those who does not have an account in the website. This type of user cannot access all modules mentioned above.
     They can only access the homepage, about us, contact, and help page. But, they can register an account so that they can be
     a customer and buy products from the website. Visitor can also subscribe their email and give suggestion to the administrator.

3. Detailed Commodity Information

   One commodity is displayed with details, such as the name, price, sources of raw materials, color, size, producer,
   and description of the product.

4. Recommendation System

   This might change in the future. This recommendation system is intended to be intelligent. So, the website will recommend
   commodities to the user based on their browsing history and furniture preferences.

5. Commenting System

   Website users can comment on one product. From there customers can give a review over a product, and seller can give them
   a feedback. This system is only accessible for those who made an account on the website.

6. Transaction System

   Customers and sellers can do transaction to each other through the website. Customer can change their address, re-check their
   order, and choose payment method. Unfortunately, this system does not generate real transaction. Once finished, invoice will
   be generated for customer, and they can print the invoice. Then, their invoice will be stored in their purchase history so that
   customers can re-opened their invoice. On the other side, seller will received the order. From there, sellers can decide to 
   confirm or reject the order. If the order is confirmed, customer will wait for the order to be processed and delivered. If the
   order is rejected, customer's money will be refunded.

This project may not perfect, so I am open to any suggestions.

I wish this web-based application can help anyone who needs an example of online store website.

Thank you!
